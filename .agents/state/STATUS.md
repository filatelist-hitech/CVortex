# CVortex Project State

## Last Completed Foundation Phase

`07-design-foundation` — **completed / PASS**.

Completed foundation sequence:

- `00-ai-system-bootstrap`
- `01-project-knowledge-bootstrap`
- `02-research-plan`
- `03-technical-research`
- `04-product-integrations-hiring-research`
- `05-architecture-decision-freeze`
- `06-product-data-ai-security-design`
- `07-design-foundation`

## Roadmap reset

The former horizontal Phase 08–12 implementation order is superseded by the accepted value-driven roadmap in `docs/01-Product/Roadmap.md`.

Accepted architecture is unchanged. The reset changes sequencing/task size, not Laravel/PostgreSQL/Redis/API-first/Truth Guard/provider-independence/ownership/design/document-rendering decisions.

Old Phase 08–12 task specs are preserved under `.agents/tasks/legacy/` as requirement inventory and are not execution authority.

Hardened pre-reset references preserved exactly:

- Phase 08 final hardened spec from commit `6ca25b09550b8315913f06382dff28f8d326aa06`;
- Phase 09 final hardened spec from commit `9267f15545cca70a245798a58179742789cf2737`.

Their necessary M0/First-Value decisions were extracted into the new bounded specs.

## Active implementation roadmap

```text
M0 Runnable Core
→ M1.1 Access Core
→ M1.2 Career Core
→ M1.3 Vacancy Core
→ M1.4 Application Draft
→ Preview 0.1
→ M2 Real Application Package
→ M3 Imports & Integrations
→ M4 Employer Journey
→ M5 Outcomes & Analytics
→ M6 Distribution & Hardening
```

Only M0 and M1 slices have execution specs now. M2+ detail is intentionally created just-in-time after real product validation.

## Current repository state

- M0 Runnable Core is completed / PASS;
- a real Laravel 13 API and Next.js 16 technical shell run through loopback-bound Nginx;
- Docker Compose provides Nginx, frontend, backend/PHP-FPM, Horizon, PostgreSQL and Redis with only Nginx host-exposed;
- root Make/configuration workflows, health probes, request correlation, persistent PostgreSQL/private storage and disposable Redis are implemented;
- deterministic backend/frontend checks and the minimal GitHub Actions quality workflow are implemented;
- no product migrations/domain code exist yet;
- runtime AI directory remains an architecture/canonical-location baseline rather than implemented Skills;
- the M0 technical shell consumes a maintainable semantic subset of Phase 07 design tokens;
- Figma live file exists but canvas review remains limited by previously recorded MCP Starter-plan capability/rate limitation.

## M1.1 implementation readiness

M1.1 Access Core review fixes are implemented locally pending the PR update. The current fixes add per-user auth-generation invalidation for in-flight session replay after disable/re-enable, forward login limiter and Argon2id settings through Compose, preserve invitation fragments across React Strict Mode replay, equalize unknown-account password verification, and preserve all accepted password bytes. The full backend suite is 37 tests / 163 assertions; Pint, Larastan, frontend lint/typecheck, Vitest (2 tests / 2 assertions), production frontend build with `NODE_ENV=production`, Compose config validation and `git diff --check` pass. The ordinary Compose development build still reproduces the known baseline `/_global-error` prerender failure; production build passes. `NEXT.md` remains `m1-1-access-core`; M1.2 has not started.

## Next authorized task

`m1-1-access-core`

Authority is `.agents/state/NEXT.md` + blockers + `.agents/tasks/m1-1-access-core.md`.

## M0 validation

Result: **PASS**.

Reproducible command results are recorded in [M0 Runnable Core Validation Evidence](../evidence/m0-runnable-core-validation.md).

Validated from tracked contents on the real Docker runtime and a genuinely
fresh worktree: bootstrap/build/start, Nginx/browser shell, health behavior,
PostgreSQL/Redis failure and recovery, PostgreSQL/private-storage persistence,
Redis disposal, host exposure, backend/frontend quality checks and production
frontend build.
